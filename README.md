# VEILHAVEN

Veilhaven is a collaborative story game where every player helps shape the world. When you first join, you are given a prompt—a glimpse into the mysterious world around you. From there, your task is to continue the story through 1000-character journal entries. You can write about anything: locations, characters, events, or hidden secrets. Once shared, other players can upvote your entry, helping to shape the evolving world and determining which contributions become part of Veilhaven’s lore.
