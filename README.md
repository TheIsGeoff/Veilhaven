# VEILHAVEN

Inspired by the likes of "falling london" - **Veilhaven** is a collaborative story game where every player helps shape the world.

When you first join, you are given a prompt—a glimpse into the mysterious world around you. From there, your task is to continue the story through 1000-character journal entries. You can write about anything: locations, characters, events, or hidden secrets. Once shared, other writers can upvote your entry, helping to shape the evolving world and determining which contributions become part of Veilhaven’s lore.

**Veilhaven** was create to fill a narative gap, most story games ether feel locked down or limit you to premade endings. **Veilhaven** while not a text RPG is more of a colabrative story / fanfiction where everything writen is true. This allows the reader / writer to do whatever they please only informed by what others have contributerd.

## Framework

**Veilhaven** is built with **REACT** and **VITE**

• This was chosen as it is flexible relitivly easy to use, which is grate as most of my projects run on hopes and dreams, lol.
• For styles I went with **SCSS** as its just alot cleaner then basic **CSS**.

The frontend communicates directly with superbase avoiding the need for a backend API, as thats to perplexing.
